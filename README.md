# DSLab2025_BenchmarkTemplate
Template for DSLab 2025 phase 2. 

## File descriptions

### Main files

- `main.py` runs the experimental study. 
- `config.py` defines the imports and macros for the experimental study.
- `utils.py` contains utility functions (if needed).

### Other files
In general, you should have one file containing the classes and/or imports for every specific pipeline step. For instance, one file for the models, one for the scalers, and so on. These files are then imported by `config.py`.
- `encoders.py` is an example file. _Do not try to import it or run it and delete it from your repo once you are familiar with it_. 

### Dummy files
- `create_dummy_results` shows wha creating the results might look like in your experiments. _Delete this file from your repo once you are familiar with it._
- `dummy_results` contains the results from `create_dummy_results.py`. _Delete this directory from your repo once you are familiar with it._
